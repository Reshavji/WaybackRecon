# WaybackRecon
WaybackRecon is a powerful reconnaissance tool that scans the Wayback Machine for historical URLs, filters out static files, identifies sensitive file extensions and keyword matches, and checks for both archived snapshots and live availability. Ideal for bug bounty hunters, red teamers, and OSINT investigations.
